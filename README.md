# Functional-and-Logic-Programming
The course will provide an understanding of the theory and implementation of functional programming. The course will review the mathematical basis for functional programming, which is the Lambda calculus, teach the functional programming language Haskell, show how principles of functional programming have penetrated the conventional programming languages and environments, and present models for executing functional programs. The course will also present the Erlang programming language, which is a functional language designed for highly concurrent environment, which require a high degree of reliability. Finally, the course will mention the logic programming languages, which are based on First- order logic, and will briefly present the Prolog programming language.
Topics covered in this course:
• Haskell programming language
• Mathematical manipulation of programs in Haskell Parallel computation
• Lambda Calculus
• Lazy evaluation
• Models of execution of functional languages
• Graph reduction
• Erlang
• Prolog
